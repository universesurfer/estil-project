## Implementation

We implemented the solution on a Javascript basis as suggested.

## Challenge to be solved


* Have at least 4 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing a User of your application, and three that represents the main functional idea for your app. Models should be related to each other.
* Include sign-up / sign-in / sign-out functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* Utilize Mongoose to create your models and add the proper validations.
* Have complete API REST that will be called from the public side to show all the data.
* Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
* Have a Responsive Design, we recommend you start mobile-first and then build up for larger screen sizes!
* Create your Angular components that will implement all the features of your project.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public, with a .co domain that ironhack will provide you.


## Problems / Mistakes

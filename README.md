# estil-project

A collaboration with students at EADA Business School to build an MVP, a mobile hairdressing full stack web application.

---

## Installation

```
npm install
```

* On both the front and the back-end, and you should be able to view the site at localhost:4200
* If you have any missing dependencies please install using npm.
* You can view the working app at https://estil-backend.herokuapp.com/

## Implementation

We implemented the solution on a Javascript basis as suggested. Some of the technologies used were Angular2, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, NodeJS, PassportJS and Bootstrap.

## Requirements

* Have at least 4 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing a User of your application, and three that represents the main functional idea for your app. Models should be related to each other.
* Include sign-up / sign-in / sign-out functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* Utilize Mongoose to create your models and add the proper validations.
* Have complete API REST that will be called from the public side to show all the data.
* Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
* Have a Responsive Design, we recommend you start mobile-first and then build up for larger screen sizes!
* Create your Angular components that will implement all the features of your project.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Things that could be improved

* First page is responsive, the rest not yet.
* Add a featured stylist page
* Link user profiles socially
* Profiles styled better
* Password reset/email confirmations
* Have a 'delete my account' function
* Investigate and implement angular2-google-maps
